# Runner image identity
#
# This file defines the immutable identity of a runner image.
# It is part of the image build artifact and MUST NOT be modified at runtime.
#
# Design principles:
# - Human-readable and self-explanatory
# - Stable over many years
# - Single source of truth for image identity
# - Additive-only evolution (no breaking changes)
#
# This file is consumed by:
# - runner (core CLI)
# - CI contract tests
# - operators and maintainers
# =============================================================================


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Platform identification
#
# RUNNER_PLATFORM:
#   Logical platform name. This value is stable and shared across all images
#   that belong to the same runner ecosystem.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

RUNNER_PLATFORM=runner


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Image identity
#
# RUNNER_IMAGE:
#   Canonical name of this container image.
#
# RUNNER_DOMAIN:
#   Functional domain of the image (e.g. base, ansible, terraform).
#   Used for high-level classification, not for runtime behavior.
#
# RUNNER_ROLE:
#   Stable role identifier describing the purpose of the image.
#   This value is intended to remain meaningful long-term, even if domains
#   evolve or are reorganized.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

RUNNER_IMAGE=runner-base
RUNNER_DOMAIN=base
RUNNER_ROLE=base

# Human-facing metadata
#
# These fields are intended for humans: operators, reviewers, and maintainers.
# They provide context, ownership, and traceability of the image.
